# uSkyBlock-API

This module holds the public API, and should be the only code thirdparty plugins depend on.

If you as developer feels the API is missing something, please create an issue on GitHub, and we will add the feature.

## ChangeLog

2.5.3 - First fixed version - detaching from uSkyBlock versioning scheme.
